  Portland is characterized by its historical cobblestone streets and brick buildings. The city's
  pedestrian-friendly infrastructure contributes to a pleasant walking experience, allowing visitors
  to explore its vibrant neighborhoods with ease.

  However, the same cannot be said for the driving experience in Portland. The city's traffic
  patterns and limited parking options can pose challenges for motorists, making driving less
  convenient compared to the accessible and enjoyable walking environment. While the city encourages
  and promotes a pedestrian-friendly lifestyle, navigating Portland by car may require patience.
  We encourage you to seek parking options through your lodging accommodations and to walk or take
  ride shares to the wedding day venues. We recommend wearing comfortable and supportive shoes
  throughout the weekend.
