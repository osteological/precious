  ### Portland International Jetport - 1001 Westbrook St, Portland, ME 04102, USA

  Portland Jetport (**PWM**) is the airport located close to downtown. A flight into PWM is likely
  to be a connecting one. Once you land, you can easily take a 15-minute ride share or taxi to the
  city center. Unless you are hoping to venture far outside the city bounds, a rental car is not
  necessary.

  ### Boston Logan International Airport - Boston, MA 02128, USA

  If you fly into Boston Logan (BOS), you have several options to make the journey north up to
  Portland. If you rent a car, you can take a 2-hour drive up the interstate. Driving time can vary
  depending on traffic, which will be heaviest within the Greater Boston area. For those who’d like
  to stay out of the driver’s seat, we highly recommend the Amtrak Downeaster which connects
  Boston’s North Station with Portland in a little under two hours. Have a cocktail on board and
  enjoy the ride! Alternatively, Concord Coach Lines also runs a bus originating from the airport
  or Boston’s South Station directly into Portland.
