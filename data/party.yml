      Dress to impress in your favorite cocktail threads that allow you to tear up the dance floor
      uninhibited. We encourage a splash of bright, cheerful hues to complement our maritime
      backdrop. The ship is enclosed and heated, so no need to dress for the ocean elements.

      To balance out the open bar (yes, the boat has a bar!), we’ll be serving some light fare and
      desserts to keep you fueled for an evening of revelry. We encourage you to eat dinner prior
      to your arrival, as this event is happening following a private dinner and ceremony attended
      by family.
