  The day begins at Luke’s Lobster, located off the Portland Pier, in the heart of the Old Port.
  Luke’s provides the perfect backdrop for this joyous occasion. Surrounded by the soothing sounds
  of the ocean and the warm glow of a spring afternoon, we’ll exchange vows in the company of our
  closest friends and family. This intimate gathering promises to be a cherished moment in our
  love story. With a carefully curated food menu, including Portland’s best-voted lobster roll, you
  will enjoy a dining experience that showcases the region’s culinary prowess.

  _A note on wardrobe_: We are suggesting a semi-formal or cocktail attire. We encourage a splash of
  bright, cheerful hues to complement our maritime backdrop.
