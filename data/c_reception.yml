  Following the ceremony and dinner, we invite you to share in the joy of our newly minted union
  aboard the Bay Mist harbor ship. The ship is outfitted for merriment, equipped with a dance
  floor, a full bar, multiple balconies, bathrooms, and even an elevator!

  Our reception will have an expanded guest list, live music helmed by Maine’s finest live musicians
  and DJs, and plenty of toasts to life and love.

  To balance out the open bar, we’ll be serving some light fare and
  desserts to keep you fueled for an evening of revelry. The ship is enclosed and heated, so no
  need to dress for the ocean elements.
