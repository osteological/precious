  We are so excited for you out-of-towners to experience Maine’s coastal charm. For you locals, we
  hope our wedding inspires you to explore our beautiful shared home in a way you have not before.
  We have created a travel guide for you of our favorite spots in the state. Enjoy!

  ### Take in the Old Port

  This is the area where the wedding celebrations will be taking place. In Portland’s Old Port,
  you'll find cobblestone streets, red-bricked buildings, charming boutiques, trendy restaurants,
  and fishing piers. It’s a quaint historic district that overlooks the Casco Bay.

  ### Journey to the West End

  Where our bride and groom call home! Grab a cortado at our favorite coffee shop,
  [Smalls](https://www.smallsisgood.com/) (28 Brackett Street), and stroll around our neighborhood. Hungry? Grab a delicious
  breakfast sandwich at [Ohno Cafe](https://www.smallsisgood.com/) (87 Brackett Street). Miranda and Devon met every Wednesday to
  talk wedding planning over Ohno sandwiches - the #1 is our favorite!

  ### See the Lighthouses

  Portland is known for its historical lighthouses, each with its own charm

    * The most impressive and best known is the [_Portland Head Light_](https://portlandheadlight.com/) at Fort Williams Park.
      You can easily spend a couple of hours strolling along the pathways to check out Maine’s
      oldest lighthouse from every angle.
    * The _[Portland Breakwater Lighthouse](https://www.southportland.org/departments/parks-recreation-aquaticspool/parks-department/parks-trails-beaches/bug-light-park/) (aka: Bug Light)_ is a small lighthouse that sits at the end
      of the breaker and is unique because it was designed to look like a 4th century Greek monument.
    * Nearby Bug Light and built in 1897, [_Spring Point Ledge Lighthouse_](https://springpointledgelight.org/) is a caisson-style
      light station (the only one in the United States!), and you have the opportunity to tour it.
