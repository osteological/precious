  There are several hotels located just a stone’s throw away from Luke’s Lobster and Casco Bay
  Terminals. Portland is very walkable and any of the accommodations on the peninsula will be
  suitable, but here are a few suggestions that are marked on the map:
    * [Holiday inn by the bay](https://www.innbythebay.com/).
    * [Hilton Garden Inn Portland Downtown Waterfront](https://www.hilton.com/en/hotels/pwmdhgi-hilton-garden-inn-portland-downtown-waterfront/).
    * [The Press Hotel](https://thepresshotel.com/).
    * [Residence Inn Downtown Waterfront](https://residenceinndowntownportland.com/).
    * [Hampton Inn Downtown Portland](https://www.hilton.com/en/hotels/pwmdthx-hampton-portland-downtown-waterfront/).
    * [Airbnb is also a great option](https://www.airbnb.com/s/Old-Port--Portland--ME/homes?adults=1&place_id=ChIJjT_rtGqcskwRC7so4Ca-c6A&refinement_paths%5B%5D=%2Fhomes).

  At busy times of the day, Portland can be difficult to find parking. To reduce frustration,
  we’d encourage you to seek parking options available through your hotel.
  If you are flying into PWM, it is very reasonable to utilize ride shares and taxis.
